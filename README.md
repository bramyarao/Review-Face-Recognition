 <br/>
Facial recognition from images is a very interesting area of research and has useful applications in real-world scenarios. This paper presents a literature review of some of the most recognized works for facial recognition using machine learning techniques, starting from 1900s. These methods are summarized, analyzed, and discussed in detail. General research trends over the years and breakthrough
contributions are given. In addition, some of the limitations in the current works are discussed and future research directions and areas with scope for improvement are suggested.
